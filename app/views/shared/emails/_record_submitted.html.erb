Dear <%= user_name %>,
Thank you for submitting your record in My ORA. <%= data['record_url'] %> was recieved successfully and will be reviewed by ORA staff, before making it available in ORA (http://ora.ox.ac.uk).
In the mean time your record will continue to be available in the My ORA interface.

<% if data.has_key?('doi_requested') and data['doi_requested'] and data.has_key?('doi') and data['doi'] %>
You have requested a DOI to be registered for your record. The DOI minted for your record is "DOI: <%=data['doi']%>. This DOI will be registered with Datacite, once the record is published is ORA  and can be used to cite your data.
